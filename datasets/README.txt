Beta-diversity datasets:

BER
COP
MAA
SYW

Ibisca temporal species accumulation

arctiidae
flatidae
geometridae
pyraloidea
- BCI CTFS: Geometridae: Species (code, genus, species) x "samples" (data pooled by sites for each survey), for 5 years. Number of samples = 10 sites x 4 surveys x 5 years = 200

- BCI CTFS: Arctiidae: similar matrix

- BCI CTFS: Pyraloidea: similar matrix

- BCI CTFS: Flatidae, similar matrix, to complement the leps.

- IBISCA-Panama: All herbivores (sensu lato?, code, genus, species) x "samples" (9 main IBISCA sites), but this would just give you 9 samples, so not sure whether this is relevant?

these are data available for folivores for the simplification analysis – 
based on equal sampling effort per plant species, for 38 spp where we have all folivorous guilds. 
We should do the analysis is overall folivores plus individual guilds. 
I shall send a separate data set for beta diversity on conspecific trees. 
Another data we would like to have is sampling proportional to tree abundance – I
 shall try to adjust Wanang miners data for that.
